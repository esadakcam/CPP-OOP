In this project, classes for a text-based strategy game called "The Warmonger: A New Dimension" are implemented.
In this game, players play as a war merchant trying to keep a war in balance to profit themselves the 
most. During the game, players can sell weapons and armors to different factions by considering their 
stats and attack behavior. Number of weapons and armors that players can sell is limited in every 
turn; therefore, they need to consider how much equipment they need to sell without disturbing the 
balance and losing max profit.
In each turn, players can 
• see the information of faction(s);<br/>
• sell weapons and armors to all the factions at war;<br/>
• end the turn(day) after selling as much as equipment they want within the limit;<br/>
• end the current game they are playing;<br/>
• quit the game.<br/>
