In this project, a fictional space agency simulation is implemented. A space agency that operates space missions is simulated. Each mission has an operating cost. Agency covers these costs
by selling tickets to the passengers. Every mission has a probability to fail at launch, however, these failures are non fatal incidents. Agency only reschedules failed missions to a further date. However, agency
has to pay operation cost of the mission.
